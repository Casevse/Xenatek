# Xenatek
Procedural First Person Shooter

This is the Unity (version 5.4.2) project of Xenatek.

Xenatek was developed mostly during 2015 summer. It is the final project of my Grade in Multimedia Engineering.

The only modification i have done since then are some details with the lighthing and a text shader, to work properly with the new Unity version (the original project was developed with Unity 5.3).

Also i have translated the comments from spanish to english.

 The objective is to beat each zone and find the exit of the level. The levels become harder as the player is completing them.
